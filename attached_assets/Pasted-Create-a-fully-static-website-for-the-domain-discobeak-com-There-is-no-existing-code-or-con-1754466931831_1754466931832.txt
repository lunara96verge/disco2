Create a **fully static website** for the domain **discobeak.com**. There is no existing code or content — you are building everything from scratch.

### Brand Concept:
"Discobeak" is a **funky, vibrant, fun brand** — imagine a fusion of retro disco culture and playful modern creativity. The site should reflect an energetic, colorful, slightly nostalgic personality with clean design.

### Technical Requirements:
- Use **HTML5**, **Tailwind CSS**, and optionally **vanilla JavaScript**.
- Must be a **fully static website** — no backend, no database, no CMS, no frameworks (no React, no WordPress).
- Organize content in **modern clean folder structure** (e.g. `/about/index.html`, not `/about.html`)
- All links must **hide `.html` extensions** (use directory-based routing).
